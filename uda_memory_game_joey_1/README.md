## Instructions

This is a simple memory game to match 8 pairs of identical cards.
The game is built on HTML CSS and JS.

I used the starter project from Udacity as a base and edited mainly js.app file, also added the timer in HTML and .win style in css.

## How to Play
The player flips the cards, memorizes the pattern and locate the pairs that match. The goal is to match all the pairs as fast as possible.
